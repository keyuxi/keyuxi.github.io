After laudry she stared at the sun
======

On the 15th day of the shelter in place order, I saw my roommate standing in the corner by the living room window, solomnly holding her ivy-patterned bedsheet.

It was 6 pm. Three sparing blocks of sun precisely hit the corner. Our apartment faced the north and leaned slightly to the west, so this is the only time of a day we got any direct sunlight. The sun would vanish within an hour.

The sheet was back lit and the stubborn brown stain stood out like a figure on the screen. There she stood, behind the screen in a temporary world of anti-reality, gleaming, inhaling, eyes closing, nose bridge stabbed by the sun, speckles and drips and drops of light shedding from her tangled hair.

"Are you standing in the sun?" I uttered.

"Nah, I'm not staring at the sun." She mumbled, "No, just standing here."

She hurriedly swung the bed sheet onto the drying rack and left without eye contact. Head bent downwards, she rushed into her room and the door closed behind her.
