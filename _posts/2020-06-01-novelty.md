## Novelty sparks breakthroughs in science and technology, but could be disadvantaged in the academic evaluation system.

How do you grab an innocent bacterium and ruthlessly move it around? The answer is, pick it up with light. Optical tweezer, a technology that uses the pressure of laser light to control particles, has shed light on microscopic biological processes from swimming bacteria to replicating DNA. The application of the technology won Arthur Ashkin a share of the Nobel Price in physics in 2018.

Fierce laser beams sound light years away from bacteria. Nevertheless, the novel combination of the two unlocked a powerful new field. Such novel combinations are not uncommon in science and technology. Indeed, they are a great source of new insights and breakthroughs. Encouraging as this may seem, metaresearch on research activities has shown that novelty could come at a price at those who create them. Novel researches are more likely to be published on less prestigious journals and have to wait longer for the recognition they deserve, despite their greater potential to be influential in the long run.

How do we arrive at this disappointing conclution after all?

At the first sight, novelty appears to be an arbitrary blurry concept, but it could actually be quantified. All research are based on combinations of previous research. Some of these combinations are old, frequently ocurring in the past, such as those within a well-established field, while some links are new. The more new combinations, the longer the "intellectual distance", the higher the novelty. As in the example we started with, the cooccurance of laser and bacteria manipulation had never happened in the body of research before, therefore the work is highly novel.

Rules emerge from an immense web of publication records. Highly novel publications, compared to less novel counterparts, are more likely to be a popular star in the years to come. Especially those who combine novelty and are deep rooted in a conventional field.
