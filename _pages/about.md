Hello, my name is Yuxi. Call me Yuxi, Yucy, Yushi, or any pronounciation you prefer. The diversity of sounds is intriguingly fun.

I am currently a grad student at Stanford Bioengineering, advised by [Mark Schnitzer](http://pyramidal.stanford.edu) in the departments of Biology and Applied Physics. I ponder about how gene expression in the nuclei of the neurons interact with all the crazy firing events and calcium influxes, giving rise to plasticity, change of internal representations in neuronal populations, and adaptation to the environment. I work on tools to better measure gene expression with :microscope:, and to integrate them with calcium imaging and behavior experiments.
