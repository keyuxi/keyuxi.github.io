Hello, my name is Yuxi. Call me Yuxi, Yucy, Yushi, or any pronounciation you prefer. The diversity of sounds is intriguingly fun.

I am currently a grad student at Stanford Bioengineering, advised by [Mark Schnitzer](http://pyramidal.stanford.edu) in the departments of Biology and Applied Physics. 

At this moment, I care a lot about neurons. I care about them as they fire, a lot of them, electric potentials flashing, tides of calcium influxes fluctuating, messages travelling from the membrane to the nuclei, transient ripples translated into changes lasting. Plasticity. Memories. I care about neurons as they are, first and foremost, cells. Central dogma. Gene regulation. No exception.

I work on methods to measure gene expression in the brain tissue better. I attempt to find my way through the maze of genetics and physiology data. Still trying.

So far, it's a lot of fun.
